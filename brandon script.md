Thank you Celeste.

Through our research, we found that the Nutritionix API helped us obtain the calories burned through specific exercise activities.

Using NutritionIX's Natural Language API, we are able to input exercise activity words
and the API will calculate how many calories that exercise activity will burn.

For example: When the user inputs the text "I ran 30 mins"  --- the API will display how many calories that burns.

The user can input:
I ran 30 mins or I ran 5 miles
I cycled 30 mins or I cycled 10 miles
and so forth.

This, paired with the data processing power of FunActiv, makes it easier to prepare a workout routine!

We also used NutrionIX's API to process items of food eaten.

The application can take foods eaten and will return the amount of calories consumed.
So they can enter 1 egg, bacon, toast for each item eaten and they should see the number of calories eaten.

So FunActiv can help you keep track of how many calories you are consuming and then tailor your fitness
activities to burn those calories.

And now Joel and Celeste can tell us about challenges met while working on FunActiv:
