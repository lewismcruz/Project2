# FunActiv Web App README.md
The FunActiv app is a new app developed by Joel Truitt, Celeste Bembry, Brandon Lopez, and Lewis Cruz.

The app is designed to help users track fitness activity and nutritional goals.

The app is hosted at ![FunActiv App] (https://agile-thicket-05064.herokuapp.com/) FunActivApp

# FunActiv Features
Users are presented with a login landing page where they can sign up for a FunActiv account.

Once users have entered their information and registered for an account they will then be able to set fitness and nutrition goals.
Users have access to charts and graphs that display their fitness goal data.

## Activity Graphs and Charts

Additionally, the application will display calorie counts for typical food items that a user enters into the app.
The app also will display calories burned for exercises that the user inputs into the app.

## Help with Fitness and Nutrional Goal Activity Planning

This data can be used by a user to tailor their fitness and nutrition plans and goals.

In future development, the team would like to add the capability to extend challenges to friends and family.
A user would invite a friend to create a FunActiv account in order to recieve challenges.

This would help make exercise and nutritional goals more fun by being able to share progress on goals while encouraging
others to join in to workout or setting nutritional goals together.
